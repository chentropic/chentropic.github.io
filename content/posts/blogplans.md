I'm hoping that this site will effectively serve as both my landing page and my repository of thoughts, guides, and other articles I decide to post on here. One of my favorite blogs is Vitalik Buterin's (founder of Ethereum); you can find it at [vitalik.ca](https://vitalik.ca/). I plan to do something similar, though I'm nowhere near the intellectual might of Vitalik and I'll focus on my own interests.

If I ever launch some venture or open-source project I'll have to add a sidebar tab for that. Anyways, cheers to a bright future for this website. Best.
